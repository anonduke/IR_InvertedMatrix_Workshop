Deep Learning Fundamentals

Introduction
Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning inspired by the human brain’s structure and function. It uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to automatically learn features and representations from vast amounts of data.

Why Deep Learning?
Unlike traditional ML, which depends heavily on manual feature extraction, Deep Learning excels at discovering complex patterns in high-dimensional data, such as images, speech, and text.

Key Concepts
- Artificial Neurons: Basic units that receive inputs, apply weights and biases, and pass outputs through activation functions.
- Layers: Networks are composed of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. Deep networks have many hidden layers.
- Activation Functions: Introduce non-linearity. Common examples: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh.
- Forward Propagation: Data moves from input to output through the network.
- Backpropagation: Algorithm to adjust weights using gradients, minimizing loss.
- Loss Functions: Measure how well predictions match targets. Examples: Cross-entropy, Mean Squared Error.

Popular Architectures
- Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs): Data flows in one direction. Suitable for tabular data.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for image processing. Layers detect edges, textures, and complex structures.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data like time series or text. Includes variants like LSTM and GRU for long-term dependencies.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two networks (generator and discriminator) compete to produce realistic outputs.
- Transformers: Revolutionized NLP tasks. Power models like BERT, GPT, and T5.

Training Considerations
- Epochs: One pass through the full training data.
- Batch Size: Number of samples processed before updating weights.
- Learning Rate: Step size for weight updates.
- Regularization: Techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.

Hardware & Frameworks
Deep learning often requires GPUs or TPUs to handle large-scale matrix computations. Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

Challenges
- Data Requirements: Needs huge labeled datasets.
- Computational Resources: Training can be costly.
- Interpretability: Often described as “black boxes.”
- Ethical Concerns: Bias amplification, misuse of generated content (deepfakes).

Real-World Applications
Self-driving cars, medical imaging diagnostics, voice assistants, recommendation engines, and generative art.
